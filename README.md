# KleeBot

KleeBot is a beginner-level discord bot inspired by Klee from Genshin Impact.

## Commands

- Use '\commands' or '\help' to receive a list of commands
* Note: commands will continually be added occasionally

## Usage

- Discord servers
- Foundation for building other bots

## Contributors

- Kenny Nguyen (@cs-keni) - Creator and maintainer

## Purpose

KleeBot's purpose is to help me learn how to work with different APIs, maybe apply some knowledge about DSA, and have a summer project to do.
Also, the only language I know is C++, so this is a good opportunity to learn Python.

## License

No license! I don't really care if you want to clone my repository and take it for yourself. I can always make another bot and put a license on it.
