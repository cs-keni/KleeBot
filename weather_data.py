    "Thunderstorm" : "What'd I blow up!? ...Oh wait, it's just thunder and lightning. Phew.",
    "Snow" : "I've got the bestest idea ever! Let's build a Dodoco snowman family! We'll start with Dodoco Dad, then Dodoco Mom, then Dodoco Baby, then... ah... ah.. achoo!",
    "Drizzle" : "Hey! Hey! Did you know? If I throw a bomb into the rain, when it explodes, it'll make a white rainbow! I call it a boom-bow!",
    "Mist" : "Misty days are like stepping into a dream! I'll use my Mystical Glitterbombs to make the mist shimmer and glow like stars in the sky!",

    "Ash" : "Wow, it's ashy outside? Did a volcano erupt in Natlan or something?",
    "Squall" : "Dear Anemo God, please make Klee's bombs blow in the right direction and only blow up bad guys. The end.",
    "Tornado" : "Fwuah!! Did I accidently make the Anemo God mad with my bombs?! I'm sorry!!"
